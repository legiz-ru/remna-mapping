A small web service for Remnawave panels. Enter your **panel URL** and **API token**, and it:

- pulls every **host** (connection entry points / domains) and every **node** (servers / IPs) from the panel,
- **resolves each host domain via DNS** and matches the resulting IPs against your nodes,
- draws the whole **host → domain → IP → node** relationship as an animated tree on a dark canvas, with live **node status** and **users online**,
- flags **inconsistencies**: dead DNS, IPs not registered as nodes, stale IP hosts, and backend nodes no domain points to.

It's built for the exact layout you have in Granit: hosts carry subdomains (sometimes comma-separated balancer lists), nodes carry IPs, and a host's public IP can live in either the node's `address` or its `name` — the matcher checks both.

## Quick start (Docker)

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
# open http://localhost:8088
```

Then in the UI:
1. Panel URL — e.g. `panel.granitvpn.pro` (scheme optional).
2. API token — a Remnawave API-role token (Bearer).
3. **Scan**. Toggle **Auto** for periodic refresh (15s–2m).

To change the exposed port, edit the `ports:` mapping in `docker-compose.yml`.

### Without compose

```bash
docker build -t vpn-topology-mapper .
docker run -d -p 8088:8088 --name vtm vpn-topology-mapper
```

### Without Docker (Node ≥ 18)

```bash
node server.js          # http://localhost:8088
PORT=9000 node server.js
```

## How the matching works

| Entity | Source field | Used as |
|---|---|---|
| Host domain | `host.address` (split on commas) | resolved via DNS to A records |
| Host IP | `host.address` literal IP | matched directly to a node |
| Node public IP | `node.address` **and** `node.name` (when it's an IP) | match target for resolved IPs |
| Host ↔ inbound | `host.inbound.configProfileInboundUuid` | logical grouping |
| Node ↔ inbound | `node.configProfile.activeInbounds[].uuid` | which nodes serve a host |

A resolved IP that equals a node's public IP draws a green **DNS match** link. Anything else is surfaced as an issue.

## Detected issues

| Type | Severity | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `DNS_DEAD` | error | A host domain doesn't resolve at all (NXDOMAIN / no A record). |
| `HOST_NO_NODES` | error | A host's inbound has no node serving it. |
| `FOREIGN_IP` | warn | A domain resolves to an IP that isn't registered as any node (extra DNS record, CDN/relay, or a server missing from the panel). |
| `STALE_IP_HOST` | warn | A host is configured with a raw IP that isn't any node. |
| `NODE_DOWN` | info | Node currently disconnected. |
| `NODE_NOT_IN_DNS` | info | An enabled node serves a domain-backed inbound but no host domain resolves to its IP. Often legitimate for bridge/relay backends — verify it isn't a node missing from a balancer domain. |

## Security

- The token is sent only to **your** panel (server-side, to avoid browser CORS) and is **never stored on disk** or sent to any third party.
- DNS resolution uses the host's system resolver first. If a name fails, it falls back to DNS-over-HTTPS (`dns.google`) — only the **hostname** is sent, never the token. Disable with `DOH=0`.
- "Remember" in the UI stores the URL + token in your browser's `localStorage` only. Untick it on shared machines.

## Env vars

| Var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `8088` | HTTP listen port |
| `DOH` | `1` | DNS-over-HTTPS fallback on/off |
| `DNS_TIMEOUT_MS` | `4000` | per-name DNS timeout before fallback |

## API

`POST /api/scan` with JSON `{ "panelUrl": "...", "token": "..." }` returns the full topology graph + issues (the same payload the UI renders), so you can script against it too.

## Run from GitHub Container Registry (no build)

A multi-arch image (amd64 + arm64) is built and pushed to GHCR automatically by GitHub Actions on every push to the default branch.

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.ghcr.yml up -d
# open http://localhost:8088
```

This pulls `ghcr.io/dignezzz/remna-mapping:latest`. If your GitHub user/org differs, edit the `image:` line in `docker-compose.ghcr.yml`.

**First publish:** after the first successful Actions run, open the repo on GitHub -> Packages -> the `remna-mapping` package -> Package settings -> change visibility to **Public** so `docker pull` works without authentication. Available tags: `latest`, branch name, `sha-<short>`, and `vX.Y.Z` for git tags.

## CI / auto-build

`.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml` logs in with the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` (no secrets to set up), builds for `linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`, and pushes to `ghcr.io/<owner>/remna-mapping` on:
- push to `main`/`master` -> updates `:latest`
- a `v*` git tag -> publishes `:vX.Y.Z`
- manual run (Actions tab -> Run workflow)
